# Learning Emacs Lisp

I used Emacs for years before I actually sat down and tried to "learn"
Emacs Lisp.

Here's the story of how I finally learned Emacs Lisp.

## Motivation

Even though I always knew it would be a good idea if I could "program
emacs," I never got around to it. Instead, I'd get mixed up in whatever
I was immediately working on ignore any pains.

This wasn't just emacs: I'd get "good enough" at most everything and,
with just a few exceptions, never spend the time to customize or dig
deeper than was immediately necessary. After all, there was a lot
going on and so many other things were interesting as well.

Additionally, I never met anyone that really used emacs, so there
wasn't anyone to really talk to about this stuff. One day, while on
vacation in the summer of 2012, I saw a [video][emacs-in-a-bar] made
by Magnar Sveen and it was *so* cool.

Yet, other things were going on, I was 6 months into a new job, I was
learning about Cucumber and RSpec and testing and Ruby and there still
wasn't time.

Until now-- about 6 months after I first saw that video-- in March of
2013.

## The Beginning

I started off by googling 'learn elisp' and ended up on the emacs
wiki. The wiki entry [EmacsLispIntro][emacs-lisp-intro] was my first
stop.

From there, I decided to try the tutorial on emacs lisp built into
emacs itself. According to the wiki page,

> The way to read the intro is to type 'C-h i' to start Info, and then
> 'm Emacs Lisp Intro RET'

### The Emacs Lisp Intro

It may sound silly now, but I didn't realize emacs had documentation
about emacs within emacs.

I had to slow down and re-read the introductory paragraph twice before
I could understand what the wiki entry meant when it told me to 'm
Emacs Lisp Intro RET'

And this was the beginning of a theme that I'd revisit again and
again: **slow down**.

And another central theme: **pay attention**.

Specifically, to what was written and sitting before my eyes:

> This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics. Typing "q"
> exits, "?" lists all Info commands, "d" returns here, "h" gives a
> primer for first-timers, "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs manual,
> etc.

I typed 'h' and spent the next 25 minutes going through the primer.

There I was-- two pomodoros into "learning emacs lisp" and I hadn't
typed a single character yet.
